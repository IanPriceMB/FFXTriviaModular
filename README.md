# FFXTriviaModular
#A Brief over view of the Project

I recently learned about pubsubs and modularizing code;

I have alwyas been a fan of componentizing my html and haveing that reflected in my javascript/jquery

but I never really took the time out to reflect my practices in my code as well.

FFX Trivia is a great project for me to revisit and try new things that i learned on related to front-end coding.

This time I will be implementing *SASS, BEM and better CSS* practices.

I will also be practicing *PubSub flow and modular JS*!

This is all extremely straight forward but practice makes perfect. 

**THIS PROJECT IS ON HIATUS FOR A WHILE**
